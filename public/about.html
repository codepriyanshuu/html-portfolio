  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>I am currenty an undergrad doing B.Tech from Vivekanada Institute of Professional studies technical campus.
    Currently I started to code and make project this portfolio is the first day's work which I learned an implemented into a project.
    I discoverd coding in 11th standard as we had a subject CS(Computer Science).
    We use to had a very loving teached named Mrs. Ritu. She taught us C++ for 1.5 month then our course shifted to Python due to some 
    syllabus alteration. And now I am learning web devlopement.
